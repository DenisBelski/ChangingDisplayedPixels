# ChangingDisplayedPixels

This project implemented a solution to change the number of displayed pixels of the uploaded image.


You can upload an image. It takes some time, depending on the size of the image. 
The application displays the download progress percentage. After that, using the slider on the right side of the window, 
you can change the percentage of displayed pixels in real time.
